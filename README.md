Open Source Code for basic Ray Tracing Structure:

https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io

My Implementation Files:

marble_element.h
marble_structure.h

class marble in material.h starting at line 51


Parameters for modification

Internal Structure Size: 
Inside main.cpp @ line 195
auto red_marble = make_shared<marble>(color(1, 0, 0), 100); 
The second parameter of the constructor dictates the size of the internal structure

Attenuation:
Inside marble_structure.h @ lines 249 & 254
Line 249 is the attenuation for low density
Line 254 is the attenuation for high density

Half Density vs Random Density:
Inside material.h @ lines 169
Can call one of the functions to initialize the cube to half density or random density.
If both are commented out then the cube has uniform density.



How to compile for MacOS using clang compiler

clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o output

To generate image file:

Step 1: Use the output file generated by the compiler

Step 2: ./output > image.ppm
